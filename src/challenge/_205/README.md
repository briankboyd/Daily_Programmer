##Mode: Easy

The goal of this challenge is to implement a way of converting two dates into a more friendly date range that could be presented to a user. It must not show any redundant information in the date range. For example, if the year and month are the same in the start and end dates, then only the day range should be displayed. Secondly, if the starting year is the current year, and the ending year can be inferred by the reader, the year should be omitted also (see below for examples).
