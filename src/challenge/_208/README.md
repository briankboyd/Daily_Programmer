#Challenge: 208

##Mode: Easy

###Description:

Numbers surround us. Almost too much sometimes. It would be good to just cut these numbers down and cull out the repeats.

Given some numbers let us do some number "culling".

###Input:

You will be given many unsigned integers.
Output:

Find the repeats and remove them. Then display the numbers again.

###Example:

Say you were given:

    1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4

Your output would simply be:

    1 2 3 4
